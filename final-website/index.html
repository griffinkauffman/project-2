    <h2>Lets Go Surfing</h2>

    <h2>Where it started.</h2>
<br>
<p>Surfing originated in Hawaii. These days, people surf all over the world – wherever there is a wave. Australia has almost 40,000 kilometres of coastline, with many surf beaches. Surfers enjoy the physical benefits of paddling and surfing, being in the fresh air, as well as the overall benefits of surfing. Surfing is wonderful exercise for the body. It requires the use of all your muscles and involves both strength and cardio, all wrapped up into one activity. Often, when surfing, you’ll find you “discover” some muscles you never even knew you had. Surfing puts your body in a position where you must use every part of your physical strength, including balance. It’s great for the heart and lungs—and the best part is: it doesn’t really even feel like exercise!</p>

<h2>It's good for your mind</h2>
<p>Surfing requires a sense of focus that can only happen when all the other chatter in your brain quiets down. By turning off the thoughts that ruminate every day, you’re doing your mind a huge favour (while having fun too!) Surfing is as beneficial for the mind as it is for the body. It’s a great way to conquer fears and do something outside your comfort zone that is relaxing and calming for your mind.</p>
<h2>Adds more to our days</h2>
<p>Surfing is an activity that allows you to turn off your brain and just live in the moment. And it’s actually fun! There’s nothing more thrilling than catching a wave and the process of trying can be filled with lots of laughter along the way. With sunshine, ocean water and a surfboard, anyone can have a fun time enjoying themselves and letting loose. There’s no better feeling than after an amazing surf session.</p>
