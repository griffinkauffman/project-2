Reflection:

Although I struggled a little with this assignment, I am happy with what I produced considering the circumstances. I did struggle a little getting my head around how the code is broken up into segments: header, footer, homepage, base. For me I found it a lot easier in the first assignment, working with just the CSS and the html pages for each web page. My confusion is probably seen in my code, as i have images coded in the wrong parts, not in the index.md. Even though technically my code is probably not sound, I am happy with the layout of my website. My production process involved setting up a simple layout on paper, then trying to achieve this in my code. Once I started my project, the process mainly involved research code, test, and repeat. My aim was to do a hero image, as well as an image grid, and I was successful with this.  In the future I hope to build on the knowledge I have gained in this course and throughout this assignment. Side note, some crazy stuff was going on with my Github. I downloaded your github commit so i could compare comments next to my code and some crazy stuff went down. I think i managed to fix it.
